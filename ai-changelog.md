### Task: Complete Mini Task Manager Backend API Implementation
**Description:** Implemented a complete backend-only API service with Express.js, JWT authentication, and lowdb for data persistence. All TODO items from the project requirements have been successfully completed.

**Files Created:**
- `package.json` - Project configuration with dependencies and scripts
- `.env` - Environment configuration with JWT secret and server settings
- `.gitignore` - Git ignore rules for dependencies, environment files, and generated files
- `app.js` - Main Express server with middleware, routes, and error handling
- `src/utils/database.js` - lowdb database initialization and management
- `src/utils/jwt.js` - JWT token generation and verification utilities
- `src/utils/password.js` - bcrypt password hashing utilities
- `src/middleware/auth.js` - JWT authentication middleware
- `src/models/user.js` - User model with database operations
- `src/models/task.js` - Task model with CRUD operations
- `src/routes/auth.js` - Authentication routes (register/login)
- `src/routes/tasks.js` - Task CRUD routes with authorization
- `README.md` - Comprehensive documentation with API usage examples

**Files Modified:**
- `docs/todo.md` - All TODO items marked as completed

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ JWT Authentication (register/login)
- ✅ Task CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ✅ User authorization (users can only access their own tasks)
- ✅ Query parameter filtering (filter tasks by status)
- ✅ Password hashing with bcrypt
- ✅ Input validation and error handling
- ✅ Persistent JSON storage with lowdb
- ✅ Comprehensive error responses with proper HTTP status codes
- ✅ Request logging and CORS support
- ✅ Health check endpoint

**API Endpoints:**
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User authentication
- `POST /tasks` - Create task (protected)
- `GET /tasks` - List tasks with optional status filter (protected)
- `GET /tasks/:id` - Get single task (protected)
- `PUT /tasks/:id` - Update task (protected)
- `DELETE /tasks/:id` - Delete task (protected)

**Testing Results:**
- ✅ Server starts successfully on port 3000
- ✅ Health check endpoint responds correctly
- ✅ User registration works with validation
- ✅ User login returns JWT token
- ✅ Task creation requires authentication
- ✅ Task listing and filtering by status works
- ✅ Error handling responds with proper status codes
- ✅ Authorization prevents access to other users' tasks

**Reason for update:** Complete implementation of Mini Task Manager backend API as specified in PRD and TODO requirements. All functionality has been implemented, tested, and documented.
